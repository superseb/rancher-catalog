## IPSec Networking

Rancher networking plugin using IPsec.

### Open Ports

Traffic to and from hosts require UDP ports `500` and `4500` to be open.

### Changelog

#### 0.1.2

This version removes the `cni-driver` service as a sidekick of the `ipsec` service and makes it standalone.

#### [rancher/net:v0.11.4]
* This image version doesn't have any specific changes for IPSec but the programming logic for VXLAN has been improved.

### Usage

#### Configuration options
